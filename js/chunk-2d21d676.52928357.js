Which culminated in creating a simple stealth game. The fun part\nwas that this time, at key points in the tutorial, Sebastian would put up an instruction to try to do the\nnext part yourself and then go on to the solution. I did most of these by myself, including nearly the \nentire 3rd video's challenged content, but generally when it came to the trigonometry stuff I left it to\nthe tutorial to guide me through.\n\n## The usual additions\n\nAfter getting the basic game done, I added in coins in order to try to co-erce the player to go and be a\nlittle more daring and to risk getting caught by guards rather than going straight for the goal zone. The\nfun part of this was that I made them spin this time! The code was simple:\n\n    using System.Collections;\n    using System.Collections.Generic;\n    using UnityEngine;\n\n    public class Coin : MonoBehaviour\n    {\n        public float degreesPerSpin = 180;\n\n        // Update is called once per frame\n        void Update()\n        {\n            transform.Rotate(0, 0, degreesPerSpin * Time.deltaTime);\n        }\n    }\n\nI found that 180 worked well as a per-update spin amount, small numbers made it barely noticeable, and outrageously\nlarge amounts were exactly what you would expect. My level design was crap, as I just haphazardly placed obstacles\ndown, and I probably made the map too big as well. Either way, the final product looked like this:\n\n<video controls autoplay=false>\n    <source src=\"/dev-blog/post-images/stealth-game/stealthgame.mp4\"\n            type=\"video/mp4\">\n    Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.\n</video>\n\nI had fun, and that caps off the tutorial for his Introduction to Game Development series. So I can check that off\nmy todo list and think about trying his platformer series or something else. I'll keep you all udpated on any more\ncoding adventures I take in unity.
